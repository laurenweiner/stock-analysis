# stock-analysis
GW Data Analytics Bootcamp - Module 2

**Overview of Project**

The purpose of this analysis was to help guide Steve's parents to make the best investment possible. His parents were set on investing in DQ, but it was important to show them that there were more options to consider that were potentially more profitable. 

**Results**

As shown below, the original 2017 script executed in .22 seconds and the refactored script executed in .12 seconds. All companies had a positive stock return besides TERP. DQ had the highest percentage return, and SPWR had the highest daily volume.

The 2018 original script executed in .26 seconds and the refactored script executed in .15 seconds. All companies had a negative stock return besides ENPH and RUN. It would be important to do a market analysis to determine if there were any economic factors that led to so many companies having a negative return.

**Summary**

The main advantage of refactoring code is that it will execute quicker, especially if you are working with a large dataset. A disadvantage may include the code taking longer to write properly. It was clear with our data that the refactored code ran faster than the original, but it also created another step in the project.
